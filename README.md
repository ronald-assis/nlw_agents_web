# NLW Agents

Project developed during the Rocketseat NLW event.

## 🚀 Technologies and Libraries Used

* **React** (`^18.2.0`): Library for building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript** (`^5.4.5`): JavaScript superset for static typing.
* **Vite** (`^5.2.8`): Fast build and development tool.

* Componentization with React.
* Separation of concerns (services, utilities, UI components).
